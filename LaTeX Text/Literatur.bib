@article{Buntkowsky.2022,
 abstract = {Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are analytical and diagnostic tools that are essential for a very broad field of applications, ranging from chemical analytics, to non-destructive testing of materials and the investigation of molecular dynamics, to in vivo medical diagnostics and drug research. One of the major challenges in their application to many problems is the inherent low sensitivity of magnetic resonance, which results from the small energy-differences of the nuclear spin-states. At thermal equilibrium at room temperature the normalized population difference of the spin-states, called the Boltzmann polarization, is only on the order of 10-5. Parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) is an efficient and cost-effective hyperpolarization method, which has widespread applications in Chemistry, Physics, Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Medical Imaging. PHIP creates its signal-enhancements by means of a reversible (SABRE) or irreversible (classic PHIP) chemical reaction between the parahydrogen, a catalyst, and a substrate. Here, we first give a short overview about parahydrogen-based hyperpolarization techniques and then review the current literature on method developments and applications of various flavors of the PHIP experiment.},

	abstract = {Conventional turboshaft engines are high power density movers suffering from low efficiency at part power operation and producing significant emissions. This paper presents a design exploration and feasibility assessment of a hybrid hydrogen-fueled powerplant for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) rotorcraft. A multi-disciplinary approach is devised comprising models for rotorcraft performance, tank and subsystems sizing and engine performance. The respective trade-offs between payload-range and mission level performance are quantified for kerosene-fueled and hybrid hydrogen tilt-rotor variants. The effects of gas turbine scaling and fuel cell pressurization are evaluated for different hybridization degrees. Gas turbine scaling with hybridization (towards the fuel cell) results in up to 21% benefit in energy consumption relative to the non-scaled case with the benefits being more pronounced at high hybridization degrees. Pressurizing the fuel cell has shown significant potential as cell efficiency can increase up to 10% when pressurized to 6 bar which translates to a 6% increase in overall efficiency. The results indicate that current fuel cells (1 kW/kg) combined with current hydrogen tank technology severely limit the payload-range capability of the tilt-rotor. However, for advanced fuel cell technology (2.5 kW/kg) and low ranges, hybrid powerplant show the potential to reduce energy consumption and reduce emissions footprint.}
